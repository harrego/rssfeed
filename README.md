# rssfeed
Simple RSS feed generator based on Jekyll

* Creates a `feed.xml` file and an (optional) HTML directory of posts to be transplanted into a static website.
* Posts can be Markdown or HTML.
* Atom 1.0 compliant feed.

## Example

The example posts in the repo produces the structure below. All that is necessary is copying the file and directory into your static website.

```
_site/
├── feed
│   ├── 2022
│   │   └── 11
│   │       └── 26
│   │           ├── example-post-1.html
│   │           ├── example-post-2.html
│   │           └── example-post-3.html
│   └── index.html
└── feed.xml
```

## Usage

1. I recommend forking the project and using it as a base in order to further configure the Atom file and feed HTML directory beyond the configuration file.
2. Get Jekyll and Bundler `gem install bundler jekyll`.
3. Install gems `bundle install`.
4. Configure the site and run `bundle exec jekyll build`.
5. Transplant the files within `_site` into your static website.
